Draft Professional Statement

Adam Koerber,

My name is Adam Koerber, I am a junior computer science student at Michgian State University with
an anticipated graduation date in December of 2026. 

Some of the most distinct strengths of mine are excellent communication skills, and ability to work and learn
as part of a team. I also have strong problem solving skills and a drive to continue learning and refining 
my techical skills beyond the conclusion of my formal education.

Critical values of mine have a strong influence on how I wish to conduct myself in my studies and my carrer,
as well as my life broadly. I strongly value collaboration in problem solving, every problem is easier to approach
when you have someone to bounce your thoughts off of, or even just with a reason to hear your thoughts out loud.
I value hard work and respecting it. Succeed or fail, you should always be giving it a good shot. Another critically
important value is (how do I put this) comedy? I believe that well placed comedy is an incredibly powerful tool.
It can be used to motivate, spark ideas, quell conflict, and make a team work better together.

What interests me about CyberSecurity is the blend between investigative problem solving, and coding. I am incredibly,
passionate about both things. And I think that I am well suited to learning and succeeding in a field that challenges you in both.
